Past Lives By Sapientdream ❤️❤️❤️

Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me, I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me, I'm not dreaming
Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me, I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me, I'm not dreaming
Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me, I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me, I'm not dreaming
